Project Report:
This being the first project I am able to turn in, I found it hard. I could not get get the image files from the downloaded packages to import. I also was unable to get the files to go into the intended directory folder I had laid out. This project, overall, uoset me very much. That mainly being because I could not even compelete the basic steps of importing the images needed. This assignment definitely had me at my breaking point.
